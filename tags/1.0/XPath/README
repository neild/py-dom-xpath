py-dom-xpath is a pure Python implementation of XPath 1.0. It
supports almost all XPath 1.0, with the main exception being the
namespace axis. It operates on DOM 2.0 nodes, and works well with
xml.dom.minidom.

py-dom-xpath requires Python 2.5 or greater.

py-dom-xpath uses the Yapps 2 parser generator by Amit J. Patel.
Portions of of Yapps 2 are included in this distribution, to avoid
introducing external dependencies.

py-dom-xpath was developed at Nominum. Nominum has graciously
permitted the author to release it under the MIT license.
